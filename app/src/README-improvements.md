# Code Improvements Summary

## 1. Fixed Component Issues

### App.jsx
- ✅ Extracted hardcoded timeout value (1600ms) to centralized constants with `ANIMATION.EXTRA_LONG`
- ✅ Removed premature memoization of MainContent component

### ProgressiveElement.jsx
- ✅ Updated misleading comments about wasActive to accurately reflect code behavior
- ✅ Implemented clsx consistently for all class combinations
- ✅ Added TODO for unused focusStage prop
- ✅ Referenced centralized animation constants

### useResizeObserver.js
- ✅ Added initial dimensions calculation on mount if ref.current exists
- ✅ Added null check in resize handler function to prevent runtime errors

### useViewport.js
- ✅ Created `breakpoints.js` to store Tailwind breakpoint values
- ✅ Used shared configuration values across the application
- ✅ Memoized derived viewport values with useMemo to avoid unnecessary recalculations

### ProjectProgressIndicator.jsx
- ✅ Removed unused imports (clsx was imported but not directly used)
- ✅ Removed unused props (onProjectClick)
- ✅ Replaced inline styles `justifyContent: 'flex-end'` with className="justify-end"

### colors.js
- ✅ Standardized on a single export pattern with brandColors for clearer imports
- ✅ Normalized color naming convention from neonOrange to brandOrange
- ✅ Updated all references to use the new naming convention

### Hero.jsx
- ✅ Extracted logical sections into sub-components:
  - HeroBackground: Handles background with parallax effects
  - HeroContent: Manages content sections with progressive loading
- ✅ Used useCallback for performance-optimized event handlers
- ✅ Improved comments for better maintainability

## 2. New Features

### Responsive Images
- ✅ Created `ResponsiveImage` component that selects appropriate image based on viewport size
- ✅ Implemented utility functions for responsive image handling:
  - `getResponsiveImage`: Returns appropriate image for current viewport
  - `createSrcSet`: Builds srcSet string for browser-native responsive images
- ✅ Applied to Hero background image for optimized loading across devices
- ✅ Uses different image sizes based on screen size:
  - Mobile: sprout-xs.jpg and sprout-mobile.jpg
  - Desktop: sprout.jpg and sprout-original.jpg

### Centralized Constants
- ✅ Created `constants.js` for application-wide animation and transition timing values
- ✅ Defined standard durations (ANIMATION), easing functions (EASING), and delays (DELAY)
- ✅ Updated components to reference these constants for consistency

## 3. Testing Infrastructure

- ✅ Added Jest configuration for component and utility testing
- ✅ Configured test environment with jsdom
- ✅ Added mocks for browser APIs like ResizeObserver and IntersectionObserver
- ✅ Created tests for responsive image utilities and components
- ✅ Added npm scripts for running tests with different options:
  - `npm test`: Run all tests
  - `npm run test:watch`: Run tests in watch mode 
  - `npm run test:coverage`: Generate test coverage report

## 4. Enhanced Code Organization

- ✅ Organized code into logical feature directories
- ✅ Improved component structure with clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Added comprehensive JSDoc comments
- ✅ Followed consistent naming conventions

## Outcome

The codebase is now more maintainable, better structured, and optimized for different devices. Performance improvements have been made through proper memoization, and potential runtime errors have been prevented with appropriate null checks.
